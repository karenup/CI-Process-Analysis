    """
    Check if a given Petri net is a sound WF-net.
    A Petri net is a WF-net iff:
        - it has a unique source place
        - it has a unique end place
        - every element in the WF-net is on a path from the source to the sink place
    A WF-net is sound iff:
        - it contains no live-locks
        - it contains no deadlocks
        - we are able to always reach the final marking
    For a formal definition of sound WF-net, consider: http://www.padsweb.rwth-aachen.de/wvdaalst/publications/p628.pdf
